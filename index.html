          (1) i. 2, 4, 8, 16, ...
        </p>
        <p>
          In this sequence we can see that the terms are increasing by adding by its previous terms.
        </p>
        <p>
          So, next two terms → 32, 64
        </p>
        <p>
          nth term → 2ⁿ

        <p>
          ii. 1, 4, 9, 16, ...
  
        </p>
        <p>
          In this sequence we can see the terms are increasing by putting a power of 2 in its terms.
        </p>
        <p>
          So, next two terms → 25, 36
        </p>
        <p>
          nth term → n²
        </p>
        <p>
          iii. 3, 6, 9, 12, ...
        </p>
        <p>
          In this sequence we can see the terms are increasing by multiplying its terms by 3.
        </p>
        <p>
          So, next two terms → 15, 18
        </p>
        <p>
          nth term → n x 3</p>

          iv. 1/3, 1/2, 3/5, 2/3, ...
        </p>
        <p>
          In this sequence we can see that it is following n/(n+2) term
        </p>
        <p>
          So, next two terms → 5/7, 3/4
        </p>
        <p>
          nth term → n/(n+2)
        </p>
        <p>
          v. 3, 3/2, 1, 3/4, ...
        </p>
        <p>
          In this sequence we can see the denominator is increasing by multiplying the denominator by its terms.
        </p>
        <p>
          So, next two terms → 3/5, 3/6
        </p>
        <p>
          nth term → 3/n
        </p>
        <p>
          vi. 3, 8, 13, 18, ...
        </p>
        <p>
          In this sequence we can see that the next terms are increasing by 5 from the previous terms.
        </p>
        <p>
          So, next two terms → 23, 28
        </p>
        <p>
          nth term → 5n-2

    <div class="trice">
      <p> (3) a + 5d = 8 -- (i)
      </p>
      <p>
        a + 10d = -7 -- (ii)
      </p>
      <p>
        (i) - (ii) => -5d = 15

      <p>
        d = -3

      <p>  
        Now use the value of d to extend (i)
      </p>
      <p>
        a + 5(-3) = 8

      <p>

      <p>
        a = 23

        So, the value of the 100th & 500th terms are the following...
      </p>
      <p>
        23 + 100(-3) = -277 (100th term)
      </p>
      <p>
        23 + 500(-3) = -1477 (500th term)
