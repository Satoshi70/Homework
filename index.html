        1. Write down the next two terms if each if the following sequences and determine the nth term of each of the sequence in terms of n:
      </p>
      <div class="one">
        <div class="two">
          <p>
            (i) 2, 4, 8, 16, ...
          </p>
          <p>
            (iii) 3, 6, 9, 12, ...
          </p>
          <p>
            (v) 3, 3/2, 1, 3/4, ...
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="three">
          <p>
            (ii) 1, 4, 9, 16, ...
          </p>
          <p>
            (iv) 1/3, 1/2, 3/5, 2/3, ...
          </p>
          <p>
            (vi) 3, 8, 13, 18, ...

        2. In each of the following A.P., find
        (a) the common difference, (b) the 10th term, (c) the nth term.
      </p>
      <div class="four">
        <div>
          <p>
            (i) 1, 3, 5, 7, ...
          </p>
          <p>
            (iii) 1, 2(1/2), 4, 5(1/2), ...
          </p>
          <p>
            (v) -25, -20, -15, -10, ...
          </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <p>
            (ii) 10, 9, 8, 7, ...
          </p>
          <p>
            (iv) 20, 18 ,16, 14, ...
          </p>
          <p>
            (vi) -1/8, -1/4, -3/8, -1/2, ...
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="werk">
      <p class="Headline">

    <div class="space">
      <div class="Time">
        <p>
          (1) i. 2, 4, 8, 16, ...
        </p>
        <p>
          In this sequence we can see that the terms are increasing by adding by its previous terms.
        </p>
        <p>
          So, next two terms → 32, 64
        </p>
        <p>
          nth term → error
        </p>
        <p>
          ii. 1, 4, 9, 16, ...
  
        </p>
        <p>
          In this sequence we can see the terms are increasing by putting a power of 2 in its terms.
        </p>
        <p>
          So, next two terms → 25, 36
        </p>
        <p>
          nth term → n²
        </p>
        <p>
          iii. 3, 6, 9, 12, ...
        </p>
        <p>
          In this sequence we can see the terms are increasing by multiplying its terms by 3.
        </p>
        <p>
          So, next two terms → 15, 18
        </p>
        <p>
          nth term → n x 3</p>
        <p>
          iv. 1/3, 1/2, 3/5, 2/3, ...
        </p>
        <p>
          In this sequence error.
        </p>
        <p>
          So, next two terms → error
        </p>
        <p>
          nth term → error
        </p>
        <p>
          v. 3, 3/2, 1, 3/4, ...
        </p>
        <p>
          In this sequence we can see the denominator is increasing by multiplying the denominator by its terms.
        </p>
        <p>
          So, next two terms → 3/5, 3/6
        </p>
        <p>
          nth term → 3/n
        </p>
        <p>
          vi. 3, 8, 13, 18, ...
        </p>
        <p>
          In this sequence we can see that the next terms are increasing by 5 from the previous terms.
        </p>
        <p>
          So, next two terms → 23, 28
        </p>
        <p>
          nth term → 5n-2
